Javascript Practice problems as I learn JS

# Practice Problem #1
   -  The first practice problem I had worked on in this project is to take a user input from a text      field #1, and output  in textbox #2 with each letter doubled, after they click the submit button.

# Practice Problem #2
- User name and password input w/ little CSS 

# StarWars Folder
- Working with Javascript Fetch and Promises along side the Starwars API to display the characters name.
